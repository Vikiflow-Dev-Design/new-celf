# User Search Functionality Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The user search functionality was working on the backend (returning results in console) but not displaying results in the mobile UI. The issue was caused by:

1. **Duplicate API methods**: The `apiService.ts` had two `searchUsers` methods with different response formats
2. **Response format mismatch**: Frontend expected direct array but was getting profile search format
3. **Method override**: The second `searchUsers` method was overriding the first one

## Root Cause

The mobile app was calling `/users/search` endpoint but getting the response format from `/profile/search` endpoint due to a duplicate method definition in `apiService.ts`:

- **Line 312**: `searchUsers()` → calls `/users/search` → returns `UserSearchResult[]`
- **Line 815**: `searchUsers()` → calls `/profile/search` → returns `{users: Array, query: string, count: number}`

The second method was overriding the first, causing the wrong endpoint to be called.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Service Method Conflict
**File**: `celf-mobile/services/apiService.ts`
- Renamed the duplicate method from `searchUsers` to `searchUserProfiles` (line 815)
- This ensures the correct `/users/search` endpoint is called

### 2. Enhanced Frontend Response Handling
**Files**: 
- `celf-mobile/app/(app)/send-tokens.tsx`
- `celf-mobile/src/features/send/components/UserSearchInput.tsx`

Added backward-compatible response parsing to handle both formats:
```typescript
// Handle both response formats for backward compatibility
let users: UserSearchResult[] = [];

if (Array.isArray(response.data)) {
  // Direct array format from /users/search
  users = response.data;
} else if (response.data.users && Array.isArray(response.data.users)) {
  // Object format from /profile/search
  users = response.data.users.map((user: any) => ({
    id: user.userId || user.id,
    email: user.email || '',
    firstName: user.firstName || user.displayName?.split(' ')[0] || '',
    lastName: user.lastName || user.displayName?.split(' ')[1] || '',
    walletAddress: user.walletAddress || null
  }));
}
```

### 3. Verified Backend Search Functionality
**File**: `backend/src/services/mongodbService.js`

Confirmed that the backend properly supports:
- ✅ **Username search**: firstName, lastName, full name combinations
- ✅ **Email search**: Regex search on email field (line 557)
- ✅ **Wallet address search**: Detects 'celf' prefix and searches Wallet collection (lines 535-552)

## Search Capabilities Confirmed

The backend search supports:

1. **By Username**: 
   - First name (exact and partial)
   - Last name (exact and partial)
   - Full name combinations
   - Multi-word searches

2. **By Email**:
   - Exact and partial email matching
   - Case-insensitive search

3. **By Wallet Address**:
   - Detects wallet addresses starting with 'celf'
   - Searches wallet collection and returns associated users
   - Partial address matching

## Testing

Created test script: `backend/test_user_search_fix.js`
- Tests all search types (username, email, wallet address)
- Verifies response format
- Provides debugging information

## Expected Result

After these changes:
1. Mobile UI should display search results correctly
2. Search by username, email, and wallet address should all work
3. Results should appear in the mobile screen instead of just console
4. Backward compatibility maintained for any existing profile search usage

## Files Modified

1. `celf-mobile/services/apiService.ts` - Fixed duplicate method
2. `celf-mobile/app/(app)/send-tokens.tsx` - Enhanced response handling
3. `celf-mobile/src/features/send/components/UserSearchInput.tsx` - Enhanced response handling
4. `backend/test_user_search_fix.js` - Created test script (new file)
5. `USER_SEARCH_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary (new file)

The search functionality should now work correctly across all search types and display results properly in the mobile UI.
