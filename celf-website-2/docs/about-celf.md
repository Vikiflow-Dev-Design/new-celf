the company is called "Clarence Education For Life Foundation" I will give you the description of what I want to be in the website.

The company is about awarding scholarships to students or to people or any person that is the number one main goal of the company, the company is also about education in general, the company also try to impact positive and legal knowledge on people most especially students,

the company was found in the year 2016, and how it has been operating is going to physical places to give exams to students and awarding scholarships to students that perform well in the exams, and the company has been operating like that for a long time now.

now we are about to change the approach of how studends or users, will be qualified to be part of the scholarship program, instead of just giving exams to students, below is the new method.

How the scholarship will be awarded is that students or the user will mine 'celf' token the mined token will be used to award scholarship to any student or user with the highest number of mined tokens,

this scholarship will be awarded every certain period of time.

I will provide you with a .md file [@CELF-WEBSITE.README.MD] inside of my docs folder of this project that shows what the website should contain, e.g pages, section, e.t.c.
