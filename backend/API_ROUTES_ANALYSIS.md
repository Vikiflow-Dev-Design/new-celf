# CELF Backend API Routes - Based on Actual Project Analysis

This document outlines the API routes designed specifically for the **celf-mobile** and **celf-website-2** projects based on actual code analysis.

## üîç Analysis Summary

After analyzing both projects, I identified that the original generic backend routes didn't match the real requirements. Here's what was actually needed:

### **üì± Mobile App Requirements (celf-mobile)**
- **Clerk Authentication** (not custom JWT)
- **Mining System** with real-time progress
- **Wallet Management** with sendable/non-sendable token types
- **Transaction History** and management
- **User Profile** sync with Clerk

### **üåê Website Requirements (celf-website-2)**
- **Contact Forms** submission
- **Newsletter** subscription management
- **Mentorship Applications** (mentor/mentee)
- **Scholarship Applications** with document uploads
