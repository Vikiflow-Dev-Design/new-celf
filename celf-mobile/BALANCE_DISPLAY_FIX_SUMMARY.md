# Balance Display Fix - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: The mining page was showing 0 CELF balance instead of the actual total balance (sendable + non-sendable). The balance would briefly show the correct amount (10 CELF) and then reset to 0 during mining initialization.

**Root Cause**: Race condition between wallet balance loading and mining initialization. The mining service was overriding the successfully fetched balance with 0 during initialization.

## ‚úÖ Console Log Analysis

From your console logs, we can see:
```
üí∞ Wallet: Balance data received: {totalBalance: 10, sendableBalance: 0, nonSendableBalance: 10, pendingBalance: 0}
‚úÖ Wallet Store: Balance state updated: {totalBalance: 10, breakdown: {...}}
```

The wallet was successfully fetching 10 CELF (all non-sendable), but then:
```
Wallet: Initializing mining balance with base: 0
```

This was resetting the balance back to 0.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Mining Service Balance Override
**File**: `services/miningService.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
} else {
  console.log('No active mining session found');
  // Make sure wallet is initialized with current balance
  walletStore.initializeMiningBalance(walletStore.miningIntegration.baseBalance);
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
} else {
  console.log('No active mining session found');
  // Only initialize mining balance if wallet doesn't already have a balance
  const currentBalance = walletStore.totalBalance;
  const baseBalance = walletStore.miningIntegration.baseBalance;
  
  if (currentBalance > 0) {
    // Wallet already has a balance, use it as the base balance
    console.log('Wallet already has balance, using it as base:', currentBalance);
    walletStore.initializeMiningBalance(currentBalance);
  } else if (baseBalance > 0) {
    // Use existing base balance
    console.log('Using existing base balance:', baseBalance);
    walletStore.initializeMiningBalance(baseBalance);
  } else {
    // No balance available, sync with backend first
    console.log('No balance available, syncing with backend...');
    await walletStore.syncBalanceWithBackend();
  }
}
```

### 2. Improved Wallet Store Balance Protection
**File**: `stores/walletStore.ts`

Enhanced `initializeMiningBalance` to prevent overriding higher balances:

```typescript
initializeMiningBalance: (baseBalance: number) => {
  console.log('Wallet: Initializing mining balance with base:', baseBalance);
  
  set((state) => {
    // Don't override a higher existing balance with a lower one
    const currentTotal = state.totalBalance;
    const useBalance = Math.max(currentTotal, baseBalance);
    
    if (useBalance !== baseBalance) {
      console.log(`Wallet: Using existing balance ${useBalance} instead of ${baseBalance}`);
    }
    
    return {
      miningIntegration: {
        ...state.miningIntegration,
        baseBalance: useBalance,
        displayBalance: useBalance,
        lastSyncTime: Date.now(),
        syncError: null,
      },
      totalBalance: useBalance, // Update main balance display
    };
  });
},
```

### 3. Enhanced Balance Card Race Condition Prevention
**File**: `src/features/mining/components/BalanceCard.tsx`

Added timing check to prevent unnecessary refreshes:

```typescript
// Only refresh if balance is 0 AND we haven't recently synced
const lastSyncTime = miningIntegration.lastSyncTime;
const timeSinceLastSync = Date.now() - lastSyncTime;
const shouldRefresh = storeBalance === 0 && !isLoadingBalance && timeSinceLastSync > 5000; // 5 seconds

if (shouldRefresh) {
  console.log('üí∞ BalanceCard: Balance is 0 and no recent sync, refreshing...');
  refreshBalance().catch(error => {
    console.error('‚ùå BalanceCard: Failed to refresh balance:', error);
  });
} else if (storeBalance === 0) {
  console.log('üí∞ BalanceCard: Balance is 0 but recently synced, skipping refresh');
}
```

### 4. Improved Mining Hook Initialization Order
**File**: `src/features/mining/hooks/useMining.ts`

Ensured wallet balance is loaded before mining initialization:

```typescript
// First ensure wallet balance is loaded
const walletStore = useWalletStore.getState();
if (walletStore.totalBalance === 0 && !walletStore.isLoadingBalance) {
  console.log('useMining: Loading wallet balance first...');
  await walletStore.refreshBalance();
}

// Then initialize mining with the loaded balance
await useMiningStore.getState().initializeWithSession();
```

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior Now

1. **Page Load**: Mining page loads and shows loading state
2. **Balance Fetch**: Wallet fetches balance from backend (10 CELF total)
3. **Balance Display**: Shows "10.0000 CELF" immediately
4. **Mining Init**: Mining initializes but preserves the existing balance
5. **Stable Display**: Balance remains at 10 CELF and doesn't reset to 0

## ‚úÖ Console Logs You Should See Now

```
üîÑ Wallet: Refreshing balance...
üí∞ Wallet: Balance data received: {totalBalance: 10, sendableBalance: 0, nonSendableBalance: 10, pendingBalance: 0}
‚úÖ Wallet Store: Balance state updated: {totalBalance: 10, breakdown: {...}}
useMining: Initializing mining on component mount...
Mining Store: Initializing with existing session...
No active mining session found
Wallet already has balance, using it as base: 10
Wallet: Initializing mining balance with base: 10
useMining: Mining initialization complete
```

## ‚úÖ Balance Breakdown Display

Your balance breakdown:
- **Total Balance**: 10 CELF
- **Sendable**: 0 CELF (can be sent to other users)
- **Non-Sendable**: 10 CELF (mining rewards, need to exchange to make sendable)
- **Pending**: 0 CELF

The mining page will now correctly show your total of 10 CELF instead of 0.

## üß™ How to Test

1. **Refresh the mining page** - should show 10 CELF immediately
2. **Check console logs** - should see the improved logging sequence
3. **Start/stop mining** - balance should remain stable
4. **Navigate away and back** - balance should persist

## üìÅ Files Modified

- `services/miningService.ts` - Fixed balance override logic
- `stores/walletStore.ts` - Enhanced balance protection
- `src/features/mining/components/BalanceCard.tsx` - Prevented race conditions
- `src/features/mining/hooks/useMining.ts` - Improved initialization order

## üéØ Key Improvements

1. **No More Balance Resets**: Mining initialization won't override existing balances
2. **Better Coordination**: Wallet loads before mining initializes
3. **Race Condition Prevention**: Smart timing checks prevent unnecessary refreshes
4. **Balance Protection**: Higher balances are preserved over lower ones
5. **Improved Logging**: Better visibility into what's happening

Your 10 CELF balance should now display correctly and stay stable! üéâ
