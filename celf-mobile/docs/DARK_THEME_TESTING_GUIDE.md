## üîß Troubleshooting

### If theme doesn't switch:
1. Check if `ThemeProvider` is properly wrapped around the app
2. Verify `useThemeColors` hook is used in components
3. Ensure theme colors are applied to style properties

### If theme doesn't persist:
1. Check expo-secure-store permissions
2. Verify theme saving logic in ThemeContext
3. Test storage functionality independently

### If colors look wrong:
1. Verify dark theme colors in design-tokens.ts
2. Check component usage of `themeColors` vs hardcoded `Colors`
3. Ensure proper color mapping in useThemeColors hook
