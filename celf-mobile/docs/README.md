2. **Technical Setup**: See development setup below

## üéØ Key Features Overview

The CELF mobile app is a cryptocurrency mining application similar to Pi Network, Bee Network, Star Network, and Sunwaves Network. Key features include:

### Core Functionality

- **Mining System**: One-tap mining with session tracking
- **Wallet Management**: Balance display, send/receive tokens
- **Referral System**: Invite friends and earn bonuses
- **Social Integration**: Multi-platform social media feed
- **Achievement System**: Gamification with badges and challenges

### Technical Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK 53
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with file-based routing
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **Styling**: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native) + Design Tokens
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated
- **Platform Support**: iOS, Android, and Web

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Node.js and Expo CLI installed

### Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

### Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## üîß Key Implementation Details

### üèóÔ∏è App Architecture

The CELF app follows a clean, modular architecture:

- **File-based Routing**: Expo Router for intuitive navigation structure
- **Component Organization**: Reusable UI components with design system integration
- **State Management**: Zustand stores for global state (mining, wallet, settings)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation for better development experience
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth animations and responsive interactions

**Main App Screens**:

- Mining dashboard with real-time balance updates
- Wallet management with transaction history
- Referral system with sharing capabilities
- Social features and community interaction
- Settings and profile management

### üé® Styling with NativeWind

The app uses **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native) combined with design tokens:

- **Primary Styling**: NativeWind classes for rapid development
- **Design System**: Centralized design tokens for consistency
- **Hybrid Approach**: NativeWind + StyleSheet for complex components
- **Responsive**: Built-in responsive design utilities
- **Performance**: Optimized for React Native performance

**Styling Strategy**:

```typescript
// NativeWind classes for layout and common styles
<View className="flex-1 bg-white p-4">

// Design tokens for brand-specific values
<Text style={{ color: Colors.primary.blue, fontSize: Typography.fontSize.h2 }}>

// Hybrid approach for complex components
<Button className="w-full" style={[styles.miningButton, { backgroundColor: Colors.secondary.warning }]}>
```
